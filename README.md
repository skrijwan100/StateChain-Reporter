## 📌 Introduction
**StateChain Reporter** is a blockchain-powered decentralized platform that lets citizens report civic issues in a **tamper-proof** and **censorship-resistant** way.  
By leveraging **Blockchain** for immutable records and **IPFS** for media storage, issues are **permanent, transparent, and verifiable**.
